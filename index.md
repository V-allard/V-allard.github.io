# Valentin Allard

**Welcome to my homepage!**

My name is Valentin; I am an assistant professor at the Warsaw University of Technology. My research lies at the intersection of theoretical nuclear physics, astrophysics, cold matter, and computational modeling. I am particularly interested in neutron stars — the cold, compact stellar remnants formed in the aftermath of gravitational core-collapse supernovae. In such extreme environments, the ultra-dense nuclear matter in their interiors is expected to undergo a variety of quantum phase transitions, some of which are analogous to those observed in terrestrial laboratories. Similar to electrons in conventional (terrestrial) superconductors, free neutrons in the inner crust and outer core of neutron stars are predicted to form Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid condensates of Cooper pairs. 

My work focuses on the dynamical and thermal properties of these nuclear superfluid phases, from the inhomogeneous neutron superfluid in the crust to the neutron–proton mixture in the core. These phases are believed to play a crucial role in various astrophysical phenomena involving neutron stars, including pulsar glitches, neutron star cooling, astroseismology, gravitational wave emission, and neutron star mergers. Those nuclear superfluids are modeled within the self-consistent time-dependent nuclear energy density functional theory — a powerful and unified framework that allows to study nuclear matter, nuclear structure, and cold astrophysical environments on the same footing. It incorporates as much nuclear physics input as possible while remaining computationally tractable.

Within this framework, we have shown the existence of a dynamical nuclear superfluid state known as a “gapless state”, where superfluidity persists despite the absence of a gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum. This state, sustained by the pinning of quantized neutron vortices in the crust, has a strong impact on neutron star dynamics and their thermal properties. Observations of transiently accreting neutron stars have recently provided potential evidence for such a gapless state in their interiors.

On this website, you will find a list of my publications, the slides of all my presentations since 2020, as well as my complete Curriculum Vitae.
